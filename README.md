## Screenshots and Explanations

### SQL Database Students
![alt-text](https://github.com/RodgerRG/MSA-API/blob/master/screenshots/database_students.png)

The students query here shows the students table, which contains the fields required of it in the tutorial. The primary key is the studentId, with the other fields being not null and required.

### SQL Database Addresses

The addresses query here shows the addresses table, which contains the necessary fields as required for the assignment. However, there is an additional studentId field generated by the migration which can be null. I believe this is due to how studentId is part of a composite primary key for addresses, to satisfy the one to many relationship. The primary key for this table is a composite primary key, comprised of: studentId, streetNumber, street, and city.

### Swagger Endpoints

The above image shows the swagger endpoints for this application. The addresses endpoints will only show get requests and allow for deletions of addresses, as there is a requirement on addresses for a student to exist for creating an address. The living endpoints allow for the creation of new addresses for specific students, as well as changing the address for a student. The one to many nature of this request means that this replaces ALL existing addresses for a student with the address change. The student endpoints for this database are basic CRUD requests, as per the assignment guidelines.

### Adding a new Address
![alt-text](https://github.com/RodgerRG/MSA-API/blob/master/screenshots/API_post_address.png)

This endpoint is how addresses are added for a student based on a student ID. The address posted alongside the ID must have a studentId field matching the ID request, and will add  the address to the addresses table with the given student ID.

### Changing addresses
![alt-text](https://github.com/RodgerRG/MSA-API/blob/master/screenshots/API_put_address.png)

This endpoint is how addresses are changed for students. As per the guidelines for submission, this endpoint takes a student ID and an address, and changes the student's address to the given address in this PUT request body. However, due to the one to many relationship between student and address, unless an existing address is also posted it is impossible to ascertain which address should be modified. With  the wording in the guidelines pertaining to "changing THE address for a student" I have assumed that there can only be one address to change. As such, any additional addresses are removed for the student in question if this endpoint is used.
